## Welcome to my Portfolio Website

In the Home Page, I have incorporated my name and the navigation bar with hyper links which will redirect them to appropriate page on click into the header. Additionally, I have included my picture in the body section, added several summary tags, and implemented a column layout and a footer. These elements have been styled to enhance their visual appeal.
